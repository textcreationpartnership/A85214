            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF duty to Religion and Subjects liberties; if loyalty to soveraigne Authoritie; if long and heavy pressures un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the enemies of all these may challenge any privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at this time; then may I crave leave to creepe in amongst the crowd without presumption, in this abysse of troubles, with my present (to this great work in hand for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation) composed of naked truth clad in her owne colours, in a few succinct Arguments, closely backing one another, as lincks in a chaine, drawing all one way in one strong cord, not one of which I conceive could be wanting, though I have stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died as much brevity as might stand with perspicuitie, in a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse so very weighty, as to give vigour and life to the active axiome of the time, and present exigent, for the finall extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the usurped duplicated authoritie of the Prelacy; the great boll or branch of the Romish Hierarchy: Eclipsing all our glory, eluding all Authoritie, by their lofty dignitie and innate Antipathy to all true Church policy, and our Parliamentary sublyme authoritie, and noble designes, to which above all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane service I professe to be devoted, and to which I here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent my homage and hostage of my best endeavours. If herein thou findest any thing worthy of observance, use it to thine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for the common good.</p>
            <p>Every one within his limits improving his endeavours and interest in this present honourable Parliament, to make the Hydraes head of Prelacy, with all the corrupt members of that
<pb facs="tcp:111535:3"/> body, the holocaust to expiate the wrath of God so long threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against this Land defiled with their abhominations, and bloody cruelties, in their long opposition of Christs Kingly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and that by an Antichristian tyrannicall government, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with all Christian policy and free subjects liberties, the vindicating whereof shall assuredly adde more lustre to this ancient Kingdomes glory, and our Parliaments deserved fame, than all the gemmes or radiant stones in the Triple crowne or Spanish Diadem.</p>
            <p>And since the Prelates of late have been so presumptuously busie in melting base mettall, and casting their Canons, and mounting them so high as to batter down all Religion, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, fortifying their tottering holds of Episcopacy in the rearing againe the old ruines of Babell. Shall not the Lords servants be much more bold for Christ, than they for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ? shall they fortifie and plant Canons contrary to both Lawes of God and of the Land, to batter downe our Religion and liberties, and shall not we reare our forts and plant Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of proofe by both Lawes, and play upon their Babell Building? long agoe, yea of old determined to destruction, as <hi>Jericho,</hi> and cursed they who shall attempt to reare its<note place="margin">Iosh. 6.</note> ruines againe.</p>
            <p>If ever were a time for Christs servants, as men of another spirit, to take courage and Camp about Babell; then now when she hath laid our Zion waste: high time for every faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, and loyall subject to be up and be doing, every one something within compasse of his calling. This is solely the Authors minde and ayme at this time in Conscience of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, here representing to thy view, a new reard battery against Babells loftie fort of Prelacy, planted with ten new cast Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of old tryed mettall, playing upon their tottering building on all parts, from the highest pinacle to the ground-work and foundation: which is not onely sandy but laid in a filthy dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, and wasting daily; so the servants of Christ may even hence be encouraged, that the downfall of it is feizible enough if they campe about it with courage and constancy, as the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites about Jericho, and we shall see it fall suddenly with Shout and Cry.</p>

The first to be looked at are the suffering servants of God, who have lyen under long and great oppressions under the Prelates, these may hence be comforted, to see their long deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted cause at length victorious, though the scidge prove long, these Canons are strong, will not miscarry if the service be hot, nay if some of them be not discharged at all that depend on mens hands and handling, yet there are enough besides in the number that will not spare them, and are in the divine hand of a jealous God, who will let flie at them, one thunderclap from on high at their blasphemy, will teare their building from top to bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, or a word from the Lord Iesus mouth, shall roote them when he begins to roare in mount Zion, his voice is powerfull and full of majestie, <hi>Psal. 29. 4.</hi> he will shake their deepe roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and lay them on the ground; his eyes are as flames of fire if once his wrath begin to burne, woe to them he finds in his way of advancing his kingdome; he will make waste mountains and hills of greatest enemies, for the Lord is jealous, the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeth, the Lord avengeth and is furious, the Lord will take vengeance on his enemies, <hi>Nahum 1. 2.</hi> and he will comfort Zion, and build her waste places, he hath had respect to the prayer of the desolate, and will not tarry, they may then be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, to them belongs the songs and palms of victory over the beast of Rome and his Image, in these bratts of Babell; these are they that come out of great tribulation, that keepe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements and faith of Jesus, that are not defiled with the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse of the whorish woman, for they are the virgins that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Lambe, and shall enter with him through the gates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Citie. The consideration whereof should mitigate their present sorrowes, having an eye to the recompence of reward.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The enemies of Christs kingdome may read their doome from the righteous judgement of the Lord of hoasts, and be at last provoked to repentance and resignation of their unlawfull offices, and doe homage to Christs Scepter, who otherwise will come as a thiefe in the night upon them, and cut off their pompe
<pb facs="tcp:111535:5"/> and power, and make them naked and unarmed, and cast them out as dogs out of the holy Citie; and so there be left them no place to repentance, though they seek it with teares, out of time, when the gate of the Kingdome is shut against them, they may howle, and cry, and knock till they be weary, ere S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Peters</hi> keyes come to open. This will certainly befall them sooner or later, if they repent not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Those that are gone back to the flesh-pots of Egypt, and are swimming downe with the streame of the time, may be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned to returne, and come out of the tents of these wicked men, least by partaking in their sinnes, they partake of their plagues; for it is the time of the Lords vengeance, the yeare of<note place="margin">Isa.</note> recompence of the Controversies of Zion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All sorts of men, loyall subjects of the King, and good Patriots of their Countrey, may be moved with pitty to helpe to remove the insupportable burthens which presse downe the land<note place="margin">
                  <hi>∆≤bi dolor ibi digitus,</hi> is the part and dutie of every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> to ruine and misery, all flowing from the Hierarchy: and till the pressures in Religion be removed, and Christs kingdome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, the Common-weale cannot be eased: they are like <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> twinns, they mourne and rejoyce, live and dye toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Tis the office of Prelacy that keepes out Christs kingly office, is the <hi>Achan</hi> sin that troubles the Land, and is the cause of all our miseries, and threatens still greater: if that be not removed, Gods wrath will not be appeased, our troubles not ended. The Lord pitty us, and ease himselfe and us of these his Adversaries, who will not have Christ to reigne over them.</p>

               <p>The Major I suppose no sound Protestant will deny.</p>
               <p>The Minor proposition is that must abide all the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery from the lofty Prelacy, their forts and mounts of molehill authoritie; but in the skirmish, we shall finde them all in a confusion, flourishing their colours, and drawing forth and mounting their Canons, and playing and discharging upon their own Canon Law, as if they seemed to batter their owne foundation, (like cunning Fencers that make a flourish on the stage and seeme to knocke downe one another, but 'tis a point of art to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:111535:7"/> maintaine the trade) but as soone as the fury is over, we shall finde them with their Canons drawne into their old fortification, and upon the next advantage in the field againe, and at their old work and battery, at the foundations of the Church with greater fury, (it being the very nature of their office so to doe) yea (if God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent not now by the diligent hand of this honourable Parliament) to mount their Canons and Canon Law to such a height, as to batter at the Royall Authoritie, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary priviledges, and Subjects liberties, to make havock of all, and bring in and erect a papall forreigne Jurisdiction in this Land againe.</p>
               <p>There be two maine Branches of our Minor proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Two branches of the Minor.</note> that the offices and government of the Hierarchy, 1. from the foundation of, 2. from the very nature of their offices and government doe waste and overthrow the functions of the Church and offices of Christ, we will demonstrate.</p>
               <p>1. That it is founded in the Canon Law, what their<note place="margin">First branch.</note> offices are, and how to be exercised, in such practices as uphold and propagate the Kingdome of Antichrist, read <hi>Angelus de Clansio,</hi> and other Canonists, where you may see their warrant for their offices, and practices in their government: to which upon all occasions they have their recourse in any difficultie, and fetch their dark light in stead of the Scriptures. So as when a new Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, a new Archdeacon, or a new Chancellour comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his new office like a fresh man, the inferiour officers that be old practicioners in that Law, must instruct him in any matter of difficulty falling out in his government, after that Law, by which all must be ordered: and that it is true that the Canon Law is the foundation of their offices and government. See a book compiled out of the Canon Law, and entituled; <hi>Reformatio Legum Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticarem,</hi> Printed 1571, and now of late reprinted and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by Authoritie; and in he Preface of the said book it is confessed, that the Canon Law of Popish govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was still retained in <hi>England</hi> to that day, and so is to this.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:111535:7"/>
               <p>Now what this Canon Law is, appeares by the Law it selfe to be nothing else but the Lawes and Decrees of the Popes of Rome and their authoritie point blanck opposite to the Lawes of God in generall, and the Lawes of Christ (for governing his Church) in speciall, and to our Kings prerogative royall and lawes of the Land. And 'tis a wonder how this Canon Law, branded and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished by so many Statutes and Acts of Parliament, should be suffered to be exercised in this Land without (as Lawyers say) the incurring of a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> being a Law of forreigne and Papall Jurisdiction, abolished by the Stat. of 4. <hi>Edw. 6. cap. 11. &amp; 1. Eliz. cap. 5. &amp; 5. Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. 23. and others. And how this usurped govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is growne to an insufferable height, overtopping all authoritie, religion and liberties, I leave to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Lawes, and grave judgements of this honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Parliament.</p>
               <p>We come then to the second branch of our proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;<note place="margin">Second branch.</note> that it is from the very nature of their offices, that they waste and overthrow the functions of the Church and offices of Christ, meerly from that their foundation and warrant (in the Canon Law) of their practices in all they doe in their offices, as before.</p>
               <p>Now the nature of every thing is best tryed and seene in the things which issue from it, as the proper works and actions of every function, springing from the roote and foundation, as giving Lawes for warrant and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, so vigour and life for execution and from thence we shall see as in a Prospect through their practices (so warranted) into the nature of their offices, and whether they waste the Church and overthrow the offices of Christ or no.</p>
               <p>The principall functions of the Church are; 1. the<note place="margin">Foure maine functions of the Church.</note> word. 2. prayer. 3. Sacraments. 4. discipline; all which like the mother that old withered wrinckled faced whore of Rome, they have most foully adulterated and filthily polluted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the word 'tis the very nature of their offices,<note place="margin">1 The Word.</note>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:111535:8"/> flowing in through their so warranted practices, to mix and mingle it with mens inventions, and shut their eyes against the Scriptures brightnesse; tell one of these Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of warrant from the word, and he will give you such a learned answer, as would make his horse breake his halter, if he knew how unmercifull his Master were to his beast, as to question what warrant he hath from the word to give him a peck of Oats. An argument from Scripture sets them all in a rage; such an antipathy there is between the word and the very nature of their offices. 2. They corrupt the word with false doctrines, from their Canons; Books of Articles and Homilies, writings and preachings, wherewith the Pulpits sound alowd throughout the Land. 3. Their offices are to cause the people drinke these troubled waters, or drive their backs to the wall. 4. They have turned the Ministery wholly into a Jewish-Popish Sacrificing Priesthood. 5. They set up a new kinde of reading-preaching, and suppresse sound preaching, silence and suspend the orthodox Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and fill their places with Metaphysicall cloudy-brain'd Humanists, Arminian <note n="*" place="margin">Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bancks.</note> and Popish fellowes, who usually stuffe their Sermons out of <hi>Aristotles</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicks, and the Fryars Postills. 6. In stead of the word they set up Images, Crucifixes, Altars, and teaching Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, to stirre up the dull minds of men, against Christs prerogative and propheticall office, to which it belongs to teach his Church by his word and works, and not by mens inventions and works of mens hands. 7. They Pope-like corrupt the word with their stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breath, breathing forth for Scripture what they please, some are the Fathers, others the sonnes of the Church, and <hi>in summa</hi> the Church of themselves, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt themselves above the Scriptures, especially when they meet in the Convocation house, and have their Canons in casting, they make lawes above and against the word, and preach for them, &amp; punish the breach of them more than the breach of Gods Commandements. 8. By ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their offices they assume a power to conferre holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:111535:8"/> upon things and places, consecrate Churches, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, and places, and place holinesse in their superstitions and abhominations, as Altars, Altar-cringing, Jesus, and East-worshipping, &amp;c. Whereas the word alone hath power to sanctifie and make holy. Thus by bringing in the accursed thing of Romes Idolatry, they are become the <hi>Achans</hi> that trouble the Land. 9. Nature works so strongly in their offices, as you may now see it in their bold impudent faces, professing reconciliation of us to Rome, pronouncing them happy that shall be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments to reconcile the petty seeming differences, and make us at one with their mother, but I hope before that be done they and their mother shall be both confounded, <hi>Jere.</hi> 50. 11, 12. For the light hath dazled them, the Sunne is gone downe, and the day is dark over them to make them confounded and ashamed, <hi>Zach. 14. 17. Mich.</hi> 3. 6, 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For Prayer, how doe they by their very office<note place="margin">2 Prayer.</note> professe and practice the corrupting of it, which as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense should be purely offred, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. They, 1. fill the house of God with smoke of the strange fire of their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations of all sorts, new and old inventions, Letany and long-som service, said and sung, with yelling and chanting like the Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> their old and new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, fopperies, second Service, and corrupt prayers, all put together, as like the Masse as an apple is like an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renge. 2. By their offices, they ordaine Priests of the lowest of the people, to offer up their corrupt prayers, as dumbe Sir <hi>Iohns,</hi> ale-house-keepers, and generally vile persons, who like <hi>Elyes</hi> sonnes cause men to abhorre their offerings. 3. All this corruption in worship flowes out of the Canon Law, as the filthy fountaine through their offices, as the pipes to set it abroad to infect the world, and is preserved as in cisternes in the Canons and service-booke, the second maine basis whereupon Episcopacy stands in the dunghill Canon Law, which casts such a foule savour in the nosthrills of God, as we may admire his patience in suffering it so long, without sweeping it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:111535:9"/> and us all together away in some strange inundation of Judgement.</p>
               <p>Nothing but a flood of Justice and reformation will prevent his kindled anger against us, manifested of late in so many fearefull and prodigious signes and wonders, especially in and about Churches, as if he had pointed with his finger that there is his quarrell, one strange fire procuring another, and threatning yet greater if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent not, reforme not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the Sacraments, how have they changed them<note place="margin">3 Sacraments.</note> into Sacrifices, witnesse their baptismall regeneration, kneeling at Sacrament, or bread-worship, wherein wee are beholding to <hi>Costerus</hi> the Jesuite for telling us their meaning right out, if Christ (saith he) were not really in the bread, our kneeling were worse and more grosse Idolatry than that of the Heathen. Thus they turne the Sacraments into propitiatory Sacrifices, to wash away sinne and conferre grace, <hi>

               <p n="4">4. For discipline, the nature of the office shews it selfe<note place="margin">4 Discipline.</note> here most, as in the strongest pulse, working with all its might continually by their Canons and Canon Law au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to oppose and suppresse Christs Kingly office and government, to repaire and restore the ruinous king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Antichrist, and that <hi>Iudas</hi>-like, <hi>Antichrist</hi>-like under a feigned profession of friendship to Christ. 2. Their offices uphold the Popish Canon law govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which hath left us no footsteps of the Apostolike discipline, and kingly office of Christ, wholly swept away in the great deluge of Popery, and never yet restored as our first reformers aymed, which may appeare by the Preface to the commination in the common prayer-booke, and were enough to set all reformed Spirits on work to perfect what they in the infancy of reformation left undone or faw not clearly, being then newly risen out of the long darksome night of Popery, and how should their diligence shame our negligence in so bright
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:111535:9"/> a Sun-shine of the Gospel as we have had since, and stirre up our spirits to search out and set up that primitive dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline they aymed at now above fourscore yeares agoe, which hath been so much disputed for, written for, and petitioned for at so many Parliaments, and been onely hindred by these Antichristian Prelates, whose office it is to justle Christ from his throne, untill the words of God be fulfilled <note n="*" place="margin">Apoc. 17. 19.</note>, because they know the setting up of his kingdome will be the downfall of theirs, they cannot stand together; therefore this hath been long their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-peice, with all their craft and cunning to uphold their Papall government and tyranny by their Canons and Canon law, to crush all who have stood in their way to oppose them, and plead for Christs owne discipline, using them worse than Turkes would have done as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse the multitude of Ministers and people in prisons murthered, of thousands banished, of families scattered, and estates ruined for standing for Christs discipline. 2. The very nature of their office is to thirst after the blood of Gods servants; <hi>Where Antipas my faithfull mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr is slaine, there is Sathans throne, Apoc.</hi> 2. 13. Of this tyranny let one of themselves be witnesse, (out of whose mouth the Lord exacted this testimony) Prelate <hi>Vaughan</hi> in a speech to D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                  <hi>Morton</hi> long agoe, (now Prelate of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resme</hi>) confessed that the persecution of these times were worse than in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, and gave reasons for it. Now let Prelate <hi>Morton</hi> speak how they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased in his time and by him, or if he will not, it may be God may exact it of him sometime with more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of conscience than any of his predecessors, because he sins against greater light and more warnings; yea let Prelate <hi>∆≤sher</hi> speak whether his hands be cleare of the bloody persecutions in <hi>Ireland</hi> of late, and if they will not, the earth shall discover her blood, and no more hide her slaine: the infection of the bloody office is growne to such a height as hath not left any one of them untain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one way or other. 4. If they all should hold their peace, the stones will cry in their High Commissions
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:111535:10"/> and Courts, their books and Court Records shall testifie to posterity of their tyranny in government. So as it hath been an old tryed Maxime of their Courts; <hi>That a good man makes a bad cause there:</hi> how hath the terrour of their Courts made many Ministers and people, like the figge-tree, cast their fruit before they felt the storme, upon the first puffe of winde of appearance of troubles, when they have heard and seene how other men have been crushed and undone by them <note n="*" place="margin">Vestigi√† ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</note>. The very sight of a Puritane (as they brand them) in their Courts, makes their blood rise and their spirits rage and swell as against the mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of their Dominion. And if the Papists plot of a long intended bloody Massacre had prevailed and not of late from Heaven been prevented, I beleeve their white sleeves would have been dyed in our blood ere now: their dog-like appetite so hungers after the Puritanes blood, as the very nature of their office so to doe, and cannot be otherwise, for this is the fruit of the old withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red stock of Romes Hierarchy, and the longer this tree of Prelacy springing out of that root shall stand, it grows taller and stronger, from the nourishment it receives from the sap and root in the dunghill foundation of the Canon Law: and according to the nature of the soyle the fruit must be, and so of necessitie bring forth daily more bitter fruits to the Church of God, like apples of <hi>Sodome.</hi> 5. The brightnesse of divine truth in this point of discipline, hath so dazled the Prelaticall partie, that of late they have confessed the discipline of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be the same with the Church of Rome; and yet they are either so modest as ashamed to have it called Antichristian, or els so impudent as to deny the Pope to be Antichrist; as whores and bawds love the gaine and pleasure of their filthy trade, but cannot endure the name. What a shame is it to our Religion and Nation, to uphold Antichrists filthy trade and government, the mother of all abhominations, and mistresse of whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; a thing so scandalous to all the reformed world of Protestants. 6. Let our deare friends and exiles in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:111535:10"/> speake, and the whole Kingdome at home of the scattered families of Christs servants, witnesse what ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock they have made of the Church; and what rule they keep in Court and Countrey, Towne and Citie, from the Metropolitane to the meanest son of the Church, how they pierck and pranse it, above all Nobilitie and Gentry, and become the onely brave fellows and <hi>fac totums,</hi> in all affaires in the Common-weale as well as in the Church. So as at length they have over-shadowed the whole State, Eclipsed the very royall Authoritie, hindred the Sun-shine of his Princely aspect from his loyall subjects, and which is not the least of all, by the mists of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions and smoak of their superstitions abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, arising out of their sulphurious Seas, like the Asphal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, they darken the light of the sun of Righteousnesse, and hinder us of the Lord Jesus his beautifull and shining rayes and influence of his sweet countenance, which like the Sun in his strength, would revive all our droopings, and make the Land to flourish, when once his throne, his rest were set up amongst us. O how would he make his rest glorious, <hi>Isa.</hi> 11. 10.</p>
               <p>Thus at last to conclude this argument, we have found in the office of Prelacy, the principall markes of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ; corrupt doctrine, corrupt worship and tyranny in government; all naturally flowing through their offices out of the same dunghill foundation with Antichrist; for if it were not in the nature and power of their offices thus to doe, their kingdome would long agoe have falne and come to nothing.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Prelates are wrongfully blamed for abusing their offices, the very nature and right use where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is to wast and overthrow the Church and offices of Christ, to overturne Kingdomes and Lawes, to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the kingdome of Antichrist; the office is so bad they cannot use it otherwise, no more than one of them can ride a horse blind and lame of all leggs, over mountaines and hills, without hazard of his neck: the office of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy is the blind and lame Jade which they are moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:111535:11"/> upon to over-ride all divine and humane authoritie, and will certainly breake their necks ere long; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the best office their friends can doe them, is to stop their gallopping, and to save their necks helpe to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount them.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Ob.</label> This cannot be so, will some say, why should the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates be so venturous, or ride so madly, they sure have a more care of themselves, than so desperately precipitate themselves to fatall ruine.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Ans.</label> Because they ride for a better horse, whence they had this, which makes them so loath to part with the Jade, and rather will venture a fall: every Priest rides for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage, every person for a Prebendary, every Prebend for a Deanery, so for a Bishoprick, an Archbishoprick, a Cardinallship, till some of them that ride fastest at last be mounted on mens shoulders, to make Princes run at their stirrup. Complaine not then of the Prelates abuse of their offices in trampling upon you, when it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the beast, and ride he must: if you would be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of your paine, dismount the rider, and knock the lame Jade on the head.</p>
               <p>And thus we see how under a pretence of love to Christ, they overthrow all his offices, as Prophet, Priest, and King, and therefore the conclusion stands firme, that they are not of Christ, but of Antichrist: and then our next Argument tells us what will be the end of them.</p>

               <p>The Minor is their part to prove. See Argument 4.

But when the Prelates father their authoritie, some upon God the Father, some upon God the Sonne, and others upon the holy Ghost, they declare themselves to be of that stamp Christ reproves and accuses of blasphemy, and to be of the Synagogue of Sathan, who say they are Jewes and are not but doe lye, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3. 9.

               <p>The office of Prelacy, is the lame Jade we spoke of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven now, and hath been long tryed by the Word, but now is growne so hot ridden, as will not abide that kinde of handling, therefore the last tryall of them is this, <hi>By their fruits to know them,</hi> and so by their footsteps we shall see which way they are running.</p>
               <p>Now the fruits of the office, wee have shewed in the foregoing Argument to be the overthrowing of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Christ, and propagating the Kingdome of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, <hi>Ex mero officio,</hi> as the proper fruits of their functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and naturally flowing through the office out of that filthy lake of Romes authoritie (as before) and therefore the fruits must needs be according to the soyle, bitter fruits to the Church of God. And here wee will take a further tryall of them, and how they grow and increase in fruitfulnesse.</p>
               <p>Such plants as are of the Fathers planting; the Son purgeth that they may bring forth more fruit, <hi>Ioh. 15. 2. Fruits unto holinesse,</hi> Ephes. 4. 24. But we see when these men once enter into a Bishops Sea, or other their offices, they soone wither and cast their fruit; how many of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and good abilities, before they entred into these cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt offices have quickly after fallen under the withering curse of the Fig-tree, <hi>Never fruit grow more upon thee.</hi> And how can it be otherwise, theres such a plaguy infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction lyes in the office arising out of the filthy dunghill foundation, which rots and blasts all the fruits of their learning and morall parts, and renders them wholly like
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:111535:13"/> the soyle they live in, and corrupt ayre of the Episcopall Seas they breath in: heres the infection, the poyson that kills them sooner or later; tis in the office, not so much in the person, but as the office infects him; therefore no safetie to their persons till they be put out of the infected places to lodge in fresh ayre. Their counsell then is not<note place="margin">A Caveat.</note> good who would onely remove and change the persons, and put other learned men in the places. O it is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test cruelty you can doe to these mens soules, you had better place them to live in a Pest-house, or cast their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies alive into the <hi>Mari Mortuo,</hi> than into a Bishops Sea, if they be good men they should so save their soules, whereas this way you hazard their soules and bodies both. Let none then be so cruell to their friends, to put them upon this preferment on so desperate a condition, wherein its as possible for them to bring forth good fruit as for an Apricock to grow in a dunghill. Wee have Christs assurance for it, <hi>A corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit;</hi> the tree still signifies the office not the person, for its spoken of false Prophets, and tryall of them by their fruits; <hi>Doe men gather grapes on thornes, or figges on thistles,</hi> still shewes it to be the office of those false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, where Christ never ordained any good fruits to grow, and therefore none to be expected, but of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt tree corrupt fruit; <hi>Therefore every tree which brings not forth good fruit, shall be hewen downe and cast into the fire,</hi> Mat. 7. 16. to 20. This good fruit as wee shewed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven now is <hi>fruit unto holinesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We will try then the fruits of this tree of Episcopacy, and the severall branches of its offices, and we finde them all taste of the dunghill soyle, they are rooted in and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their proper nourishment from, and are no <hi>fruits unto holinesse:</hi> For wee doe finde by wofull experience, that the fruits of their offices and government hath filled the Land with all prophanenesse, and sinning with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse in all licentiousnesse, and therefore unholy offices, an unholy government, which not onely countenance sincks of sin and wickednesse, but live in and are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:111535:13"/> by the vices of men, as the hire of whores, selling of sinnes and filthinesse, commutations of pennance, and oppressions of his Majesties Subjects, and disabling them for King and Countryes service. This is the chiefe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their offices, which if once, with the Canon Law that warrants these practices, were taken away, we should quickly see this great Amphitheater of Prelacy moulder downe and fall into the dunghill from whence it arose, and then one faire flood of Justice from this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Parliament, would soone sweep away all the filth together, and clense the Land of these corrupt and contagious offices.</p>
               <p>The seats of their offices, their Cathedrall Cities and Pallaces are very dennes of all filthinesse and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the most uncleane birds in the Countrey resort to dwell under their shadow, as having there libertie to live in all licentiousnesse.

These Prelates are so Cock-sure in their warme nests as in the clefts of the Rocks, that they shew little feare of God or his revenging Justice, as if they had writ over their gates, Mock God, Mock Devill, Babel-like at defiance with both; <hi>I sit as a Queene and shall never be moved,</hi> Isa. 47.

For honour of the King, they so farre observe it as their own honour is concerned, and in the first place regarded, the other must but serve it. 3. And because they have not honour enough, or be high enough, they are busie medling with Papists and Jesuites, the great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists of the world for changes of Kings and Kingdomes and States, turning them up-side downe, to change our Lawes, our Religion, and liberties, and lives too; and to plant the Land with Spaniards, as we had found ere now, if the Spanish Fleet last yeare had once landed, but blessed be God, who without us prevented it, and broke that devillish designe, and gives us faire warning to take heed to such Prelates, so officious in their offices, whose na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture sures so with the Jesuites, alwayes digging under ground and working changes. They have sucked all the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:111535:16"/> nourishment to higher advancement that this State can afford them, and so full ripe for a Miter and a Cardinalls cap, which here are not, that tis high time they were gone where they may have them, rather than they bring Rome and Spaine to us to obtaine them.</p>

Are not these brave Spirits will venture upon such hard service for their Master? The King of Spaine we heare stands in need of such artists to blow up the walls of Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, tis pitty he should want them.</p>
               <p>And therefore Right Honourable, bestirre your selves betime to meete those underminers with a countermine, to spring them and their works together: theres no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of safetie to our King and his posteritie, and all these three Kingdomes, so linked together in so many bands, as we must of necessitie stand and fall together.

               <p>Though now it might seeme we have enough of the Prelates windie divine authoritie, now found none of Gods planting, as by their fruits at Christs command we have tryed and found them: and therefore nothing now wanting, but the execution of his own sentence, to be rooted out, which we now expect by the diligent hand of this Honourable Parliament.

               <p>The said <hi>Tho: Duresme</hi> amongst his palatine Souldiers, most Papists, in these late Episcopall broyles, was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have in his Coach with him one of the most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Papists in the North, &amp; fit to be one of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Warre in his regalitie, and in that Episcopall quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with the <hi>Scots;</hi> which being publickly taken notice of, was very offensive to many, and scandalous to his Majesties government, and to his pretended divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, to see <hi>Tho: Duresme</hi> so accompanied: I know not what he can say to this, but that he left his Rochet and office at his Sea of <hi>Duresme,</hi> and now in his regalitie no more Bishop; as the Lutherane Priests in Germany, when they goe to a feast, lay downe their black gowne, saying, Lie thou there Priest, now Ile be as joviall as the best of you: so <hi>Camelion</hi>-like change into any colour.</p>

               <p>He also connives at dangerous meetings of the most stirring Papists, their baptismes and night burialls, with tapers, and torches, and bells ringing, but without the use of the Service Booke, and against their owne Canons: whereby it appeares, their Service Booke and Canons serve onely against puritanes, and must not be discharged against Papists. So as the chiefe Townes of his diocesse, are of late become dennes of Papists, and places of resort to their meetings and Masses, and of traffique and trade in their Books and Beads and Romish Merchandize.</p>
               <p>All which considered, he may be said to have given the lye to all his former works and writings against the Papists. So that it may be verified of him, that he is the greatest Papist friend that ever came in <hi>Duresme</hi> since our
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:111535:18"/> reformation. See here how the Antichristian office hath blasted all his fruits, and made him the shame of his old age, and of that pretended divine office of Episcopacy, which now the Lord will have made naked to the world. And all this flowes out of the dunghill foundation and filthy nature of the office, serving principally to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Antichrists kingdome, to waste the Church and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow the offices of Christ. So as it would seeme that Episcopacy now is come to its full height and ripenesse in this Land: it hath ever since our reformation opposed Christs kingly office, as its mortall enemy, whereby its growne to this height at this day to overthrow his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall and Priestly offices also: that all the world may see, as in the Sun-shine, that the offices and government of the Prelacy, are meerly Antichristian.</p>
               <p>By this time, I thinke, they have done, and so have we with their divine Authoritie, as having too long raked in that dunghill, and therefore we come now to the issue. That since they cannot reckon up their genealogie from <hi>Levie,</hi> (from another divine authoritie than the Canon Law) let them as polluted be put from the Priesthood, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 7 64. Thus did good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and the Princes, true patternes of reformation before us. The Lord put into the hearts of his Majestie, and the Worthies of this Honourable Parliament, to follow their example, and to clense the Land of this polluted Priesthood and filthy dunghill offices of Antichristian Authoritie, which hath so long eclipsed the Gospels light, and the name and fame of our Nations glory in the eyes of all the reformed world, who with the bulk and body of Popery, have also cast off this heavie yoke and regiment of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.</p>
               <p>Therefore as not compatible with Christs kingly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and scepter of his Word, with Our royall Kings Authoritie, our Sions peace, and Kingdomes glory in the flourishing of Christs Kingdome.

Therefore doe not this work of the Lord negligently; if you curbe their greatnesse and lop the branches never so much, and leave the root, the office in the ground, within their warme nests and Episcopall Seas, though you shall binde it downe with Iron bands, and lay upon it all the weight of good Lawes you can possibly devise, it will through the sent of the puddle water, bud and spring againe next<note place="margin">Iob 14. 9.</note> season, and bring forth more bitter fruits than ever: Episcopacy, (not the persons is the root of all our evills)

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Church and faithfull Ministers have not all light at once or by one instrument, or yet by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worthy lights, the remembrance of whom is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and therefore as we would not detract any thing of their deservings from them, so must we not stick fast in their footsteps and goe no further.

Christ Jesus comes to his people as the Sunne arises, first, theres the dawning, then the darknesse expelled, and still brighter light, till the Sunne shine in his full strength.</p>
               <p>Secondly, These worthy Martyrs that were Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san Bishops, in the dawning of the Gospels light after a long darksome night of Popery, must be confessed to rise up in their Rochets out of the Papacy, and saw not presently into the unlawfulnesse of their office, yet some of them did and resigned, as <hi>Latimer;</hi> but they set themselves against the most cleare corruptions in doctrine and worship, so farre as they had light; as for Discipline it was so swept away in that great deluge of Popery, that no footsteps of it were to be seene in those times, or if any thing of it, yet but as the blinde man in the Gospell recovering his sight, saw men walking like trees, very darkly and confusedly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As their sight grew somewhat clearer, they saw into a godly discipline in the primitive Church, at which they aymed, as in the Preface to the Common prayer book at the Commination may be seene, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes they saw into another discipline than that they had amongst them, and brought with them out of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and is used to this day, therefore not the right dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:111535:21"/> and yet that primitive discipline, it is as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they saw at a great distance even then, and so left it to be searched out more clearly of the following genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and if they did see it any thing clearly, and if any thing hindered their light of breaking out into a more full reformation, we may thank even the Diocesan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops for it, whose love of preheminence as ours now was the chiefe let in reformation in those times, as our Histories shew. So as we have little cause to boast of Bishops, as instruments of our reformation, if we were well acquainted with the state of those times, and what hinderers of Reformation the Bishops were, yea some of them that after suffered as Martyrs in Queene <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> time.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Some Bishops suffering as Martyrs after their morning light was clouded againe with hot perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions and stormes arising, even out of the same Seas they were in, by the changing of the winde in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time, is no more an argument from their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome that their office was good, than if a Cardinall in Rome or Spaine should professe the Gospell, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for it: his office were neverthelesse still Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, When these stormes were over, and a greater light broke out in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, of a brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sunne-shine, multitudes of learned and godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters began to see clearly the foundation of Babell lay close and unseene in the office of Episcopacy, and in the keeping out Christs Kingly office especially, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preached, writ, disputed, and suffered for it, even as Martyrs of those times by the tyranny of the Prelates who still oppose it to this day; as witnesse <hi>Cartwright, Parker, Fenner, Childerley, Chatterton, Traverse, Reinolds,</hi> and a many more; and at King <hi>James</hi> his first entrance about a thousand Ministers stood for Reformation of the Episcopall government, and for setting up of Christs Kingly office, who were in a few yeares wasted and spent and banished and devoured of these ravenous Wolves,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:111535:21"/> wives and children undone, and many families scattered, estates ruined for opposing this prelaticall office and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, so as little cause have we to boast of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, it hath been a bloody office to this day. Also many living yet can witnesse how a reformation hath been still petitioned for to Parliaments, even to this day: though with no successe, because their sins were not full, nor ours repented of and reformed.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, For many worthy instruments in Magistracy and Ministery, submitting to Episcopall government. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Divine examples, (but not humane) doe binde the Conscience, and make their practises rules to us; secondly, the Churches of a whole Nation, yea of many Nations, abounding with men of excellent parts, both in the Magistracy and Ministery, may yet long neglect some of Gods Ordinances, partly through ignorance, partly for want of assistance of the supreme Magistrate, as all the times of the Judges, and many good Kings, even from <hi>Joshua</hi> to the time of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> the feast of keeping of boothes was neglected. Because, first, theres much naturall blindnesse in the best men: secondly, the Church often too carelesse in some weighty things: thirdly, men are ready to sit downe ere their work be half done, soone weary in so great and publick works as Reformation is: the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weake. Thus as they of old long neglected the feast of boothes, so have we too long neglected Christs discipline and government: the Lord pardon it.</p>
               <p>Seventhly and lastly, for the flourishing of Religion under the Prelates government, we have no cause to thanke them; they have alway persecuted the light and life of it, and done their best to put out the light, and to bring in an Egyptian darknesse againe: secondly, it hath been those they have most persecuted who have spread the greatest light, for a persecuted light is ever the brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, which shews it to be of God, and like to him, though darknesse comprehend it not; to him be glory that we have any light after so hot persecutions, and so many ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:111535:22"/> this is a signe our persecuted light shall prevaile: <hi>Tandem bona causa triumphat,</hi> was that renowned old Duke of Saxons Motto in all his bitter troubles with <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Thirdly, though some see it not, so sleepy-headed in their ease and pleasures, they little regard the hazard Gods Ark is in, yet others that have watched long in the long winter night of the Churches troubles, for the daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the day of deliverance, have found iil fruits of flourishing of Religion, and seene a great decay of the power of godlinesse these many yeares past, and many Ministers and professors fallen, some in following the sway of the times for worldly things, others through pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillanimitie of spirit, into great decay of gifts and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, all for want of Christs discipline, to keepe all men in their severall stations, and active in obedience; and to hedge in the Church from the inroades of enemies. The Lord teach us the use and benefit of, and open our eyes to see the want of, &amp; pardon our so long neglect of Christs Kingly office.</p>

               <p>Since now the pretended divine Authoritie of the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy is fayled in the foundation, and left them no foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but in the filthy dunghill of the Canon Law of the Popes Authoritie, exalted above the Scriptures, in which they Mother like have built their nests, as in the clefts of the rocks of the seven hilled Citie.

               <head>A short appendix touching Discipline.</head>
               <p>Since in this great and honourable High Court of Parliament, every subject is so concerned as bound to submit to what shall be therein established, therefore as a member and well-wisher of the well-fare of the whole body, I crave leave for a word or two concerning disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. Since tis now in every mans mouth, what forme of discipline we shall have, when the Prelaticall, as none of Christs, shall be justly abolished. Which seems to me to upbraid the ignorance and unthankfulnesse of this age, (the fruits of Episcopacy) as if men in the Sun-shine should complaine of darknesse: or as if the Spirit of Christ which descended upon the Apostles, teaching all things, and leading them into all truth, should have left them wandring at randome without direction in governing the house of God; or yet left it arbitrary to mens seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall minds, humours, and frames. The Scriptures are full and plentifully furnished with instructions for the whole frame and fashions of the house of GOD, which all brought together and set up, would be a beautifull stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; it is the tabernacle of God with men, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

All I have to say in one word, tis that I would consent to; keepe close to that patterne, and beware of the severall frames of mens braines, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne the Church by humane policy, after the manner of earthly Kingdomes and States, which was the first thing brought in the plague of Episcopacy, and will still leave a back-dore to papall tyranny in the Church of God: from which we can never be secured untill Christs own government be established, tis his own Scepter must rule and no inventions of men or Angels, if possibly they could be consulted with.</p>
